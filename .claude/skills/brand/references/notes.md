# The notes

## Layout

```
brand/
  positioning.md       what the business does, for whom, what makes it different; the name as it
                       should appear, the tagline, a one-paragraph description; contact and social links
  voice.md             the voice card and fingerprint (references/voice.md)
  audience.md          the actual people who buy, what they worry about, where they are when the
                       need shows up, what convinces them
  visual-identity.md   colours by role, type, logo, imagery (references/visual.md)
  do-and-dont.md       observable rules; words used and never used
  logo/                the logo files, svg preferred
  images/              a small curated set of the business's best photos; images.md describes each
  <anything>.md        further notes are welcome and read as context
public/
  business.md          type: business, one per business
  services.md          type: offering; or one note per offering when there are more than four
  locations.md         type: location; or one note per site, for a business with several
  faq.md               type: faq
  team.md              type: entity
  policies.md          type: policy (guarantees, cancellations, payment terms, service area)
  proof.md             type: proof
legal/                 terms, privacy, cookies, returns: copied verbatim, never rewritten
```

`brand/` is the look and the sound; `public/` is anything the business would
say to a stranger. Internal knowledge (SOPs, pricing logic, people's
details) belongs in neither.

## A note

```markdown
---
title: Emergency hose repair
type: offering
updated: 2026-09-02
status: current
sources:
  - raw/site/example.com/pages/services.md
  - raw/transcripts/2026-08-30-chat.md
---

One paragraph that answers "what is this" for someone who has never heard of
it. Call-outs are $180 (raw/site/example.com/pages/pricing.md).
```

Every note has `title`, `type`, `updated`, `status` and `sources`. Facts in
the body carry their raw path in brackets.

## Typed frontmatter

Apps read these fields as data (a website renders its footer, contact
section and JSON-LD from them), so the atomic facts live in frontmatter and
the prose lives in the body. Leave a field empty rather than guess.

```yaml
# public/business.md                    type: business
schema_type: LocalBusiness              # or the fitting schema.org subtype: Plumber, Dentist, Restaurant …

# public/services.md (or one per offering)     type: offering

# public/faq.md                         type: faq: each question a `## ` heading, the answer beneath

# public/proof.md                       type: proof
items:
  - { quote: "…", who: "J. Okafor, Clifton", platform: Google, date: 2026-03-02, source: raw/places/abc.json }
```

Legal pages go in `legal/<slug>.md` with `path` (the old URL) and `title`
frontmatter, the text verbatim.

## Sources in order of trust

For facts (name, phone, address, hours, prices): the site's own structured
data (`raw/site/<host>/structured/`), then the public listing in
`raw/places/`, then `_index/facts.json` (each fact with where it was found),
then page text, then documents. The owner's word in chat overrides all of
them, saved to `raw/transcripts/` first.

Contact facts come only from the business's own pages, header, footer and
listing, never from reviews, comments or blog posts, where other people's
numbers appear.

## Updating

- Change the note, bump `updated`, add the new source.
- Keep the replaced value on a line: `superseded: "Mo-Fr 08:00-16:00" (raw/site/…/contact.md, 2026-01-10)`.
- Two current sources disagree: keep both in the body, marked **conflict**,
  and tell the owner. Resolve it when they answer, citing their answer.
