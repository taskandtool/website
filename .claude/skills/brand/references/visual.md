# The look

`brand/visual-identity.md` is stated precisely enough to build from: a
website compiles it into design tokens, marketing builds image prompts from
it. Every value is read from real material and cited, or left to fill.

## Colours

Six-digit hex, each with its role and where it is used today: the primary
(the one action colour), a dark, a light, a neutral for secondary text, and
any others. From a crawl, `raw/site/<host>/_index/styles.json` has the
computed colours by role; check them against the screenshots in `shots/`,
since a site's CSS often carries colours it never shows. From a logo or
photos alone, sample the logo's colours and say that is the source.

## Type

The display and body families, their weights, and where they load from
(Google Fonts, a file, a system font). `styles.json` names them for a crawled
site.

## Logo

Copy the files into `brand/logo/`, svg preferred, with a dark and a light
version when both exist. From a crawl, `_index/media.json` marks the logo
candidates. If there is no usable file, say so; do not draw one.

## Photos and imagery

`brand/images/` holds a small curated set (about 10 to 30) of the
business's best real photographs, copied from `raw/`. Pick for quality and
range: the work, the place, the people, the product. Leave out stock,
icons, theme art and anything blurry or tiny.

`brand/images.md` has one line per file: what it shows, who is in it, the
focal point, and whether the owner (and the customer, when it is their home
or face) agreed it may be used in advertising. Ask for the permissions in
one message.

The **Imagery** block in `visual-identity.md` describes the photography so
anyone can brief new images in the same style. Look at the photos
themselves, not their file names:

- what the photos show, and the settings they are taken in
- the light (time of day, hard or soft, warm or cool)
- the materials and textures, and the object that carries the brand's colour
- the people rule (who appears, how, or never)
- what never appears
- a one-paragraph style anchor that sums it up
