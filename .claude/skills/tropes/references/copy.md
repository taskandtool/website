# Copy tells

Structures outlast word lists: the vocabulary moves with each model generation (re-check it every six months), the shapes do not. `tropes.mjs` finds the ones a pattern can (the id beside a trope is the rule it prints; the phrase tables are `refused-phrase`); the rest need an ear.

| Invented proof: stats, studies, testimonials, review counts, "a customer", hardcoded five stars | Only from the owner's material, with name, count, source, date. If there is no source, it becomes a `NEED:` question for the owner. Never soften it into a vaguer claim |
| Vague attribution ("industry reports", "experts agree", "studies show") | Name the source or cut |
| Generic examples / cookie-cutter case studies | One real job, place, number or name per section |
| Fake urgency ("only 3 left", countdowns) | Only when true and sourced |
| Personal-attribute phrasing in ads `personal-attribute` ("Struggling with your debt?", "Are you overweight?") | Meta refuses it. Speak about the offer, not the reader's condition |
| A number as the whole answer ("15 towns") | The list goes with the number |
